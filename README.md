👨‍💻 About Me

  Hey there! I'm **Sathyan**, an **Associate Software Developer** with a passion for crafting **ERP applications** that streamline business processes. I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly web solutions using **JavaScript**, **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. My goal is to create scalable, efficient, and visually appealing applications that solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, I dive into poetry and books to spark my creativity and inspire innovative solutions.

🌱 Mastering advanced React.js patterns and Node.js optimizations  
💡 Enthusiastic about creating seamless user experiences with Ant Design  
⚡ Fun fact: I write poetry to unwind and fuel my creative coding!
